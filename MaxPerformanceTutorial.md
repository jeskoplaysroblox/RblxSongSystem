# Mod list
**To start, install the following mods:**
Sodium, Sodium Extras, Reese's Sodium Options, FerriteCore, DynamicFps, EntityCulling, ModernFix, Mod Menu, and Cloth Config.

**Next, to configure all settings properly, follow these steps:**
Options > Video options
You'll see tons of options, set all of these settings:

Render distance: 2, or 10 if you want baritone to be able to see.
Simulation distance: 5
Max framerate: 30-40 if you REALLY need low resource usage, or 60 if you can spare enough.
Next go to the quality tab, on the left and set these settings:
Graphics: Fast
Clouds: Off
Weather: Fast
Leaves: Fast
Particles: Minimal
Entity distance: 25-100 or 300-500 if you want baritone to be able to see.
Smooth lighting: Off/False
Entity shadows: Off/false
MipMap levels: 0
Biome blend: 1 Block(s)
Next go to the particles tab, and uncheck the All option at the very top to disable ALL particles.
Next go to the Details tab, and set these settings:
Sky: Off/False
Stars: Off/False
Sun: Off/False
Moon: Off/False
Weather: Off/False
Next go to the Render tab and set these settings:
Single Fog: OFF (Drag the slider all the way to the right.)
Beacon beam: Off/False
Next, go back to the game, press esc, press on the Mods button, find DynamicFps, hover over it, press the settings icon that appears on the mod icon, and set these settings:
In the general tab, under idling, set Idle timeout to 1-2 minutes.
Set idle condition to None.
Next, head to the Unfocused tab, and set these settings:
Vsync: No
Frame Rate Target: 1-5 FPS (limits the game to that fps amount when not tabbed in, does not hurt the performance of any mods, just saves resources.)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Set to around 20-30 if you're on a higher end PC.
Next, head to the Idle tab and set these settings:
Vsync: Off
Frame Rate Target: 1-10 FPS (Same as Unfocused FPS target, just when you haven't interacted with the game for a bit. Once again, does not hurt the performance of mods, only saves resources.)


**And thats about it, you should be done now. You can change any setting to your liking, but for getting maximum performance for the rest of your PC, thats what I'd recommend.**
