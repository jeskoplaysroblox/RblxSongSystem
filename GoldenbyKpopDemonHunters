I Was A Ghost I Was Alone Hah
Eoduwajin Hah Apgil Soge (Ah)
Given The Throne I Didn’t Know How To Believe
I Was The Queen That I’m Meant To Be

I Lived Two Lives Tried To Play Both Sides
But I Couldn’t Find My Own Place
Called A Problem Child ‘Cause I Got Too Wild
But Now That’s How I’m Getting Paid Kkeuteopshi On Stage

I’m Done Hidin’ Now
I’m Shinin’ Like I’m Born To Be
We Dreamin’ Hard We Came So Far Now I Believe

We’re Goin’ Up Up Up It’s Our Moment
You Know Together We’re Glowing
Gonna Be Gonna Be Golden
Oh Up Up Up With Our Voices
Yeongwonhi Kkaejil Su Eomneun
Gonna Be Gonna Be Golden


Oh I’m Done Hidin’ Now
I’m Shinin’ Like I’m Born To Be
Oh Our Time No Fear No Lies
That’s Who We’re Born To Be

Waited So Long To Break These Walls Down
To Wake Up And Feel Like Me
Put These Patterns All In The Past Now
And Finally Live Like The Girl They All See

No More Hiding I’ll Be Shining Like I’m Born To Be
‘Cause We Are Hunters Voices Strong And I Know I Believe

We’re Goin’ Up Up Up It’s Our Moment
You Know Together We’re Glowing
Gonna Be Gonna Be Golden
Oh Up Up Up With Our Voices
Yeongwonhi Kkaejil Su Eomneun
Gonna Be Gonna Be Golden


Oh I’m Done Hidin’ Now
I’m Shining Like I’m Born To Be
Oh Our Time No Fears No Lies
That’s Who We’re Born To Be

You Know We’re Gonna Be Gonna Be Golden
We’re Gonna Be Gonna Be
Born To Be Born To Be Glowin’
Balkke Bitnaneun Urin
You Know That It’s Our Time No Fears No Lies
That’s Who We’re Born To Be
