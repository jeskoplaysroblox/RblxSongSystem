# Hello.
*You've stumbled across a (mostly) private repo made solely to be a database, since I couldn't be bothered to find any other way to store song lyrics.*
# About "Lyrics bot"
***LyricsBot*** is a project of mine intended to print out song lyrics in minecraft chat, it operates off of this github for its database of lyrics.
***LyricsBot*** operates off a headless minecraft instance, with a JS script ran alongside to control it.

# Lyrics submissions
To submit songs to be added to the bots database, open an issue with the song you'd like, and the person who made the song.
