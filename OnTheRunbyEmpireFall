I spend my life on the run
Through the sand and the mud
Every path under the sun
Jump the bridges I burn
I have climbed and swum and crawled
But it's still on my back
This ever growing dark
Always returns
Through the sand and the mud
I spend my life on the run

Mayday
Not okay
Caught in the same damn old
Groundhog day
Fiending
From within
The beast is out for blood
Closing in

And I know what it wants
And I'm not gonna bite
But I'm starting to feel out of breath
Like I'm stuck in a swamp
Day and night, it's a fight to the death

I spend my life on the run
Through the sand and the mud
Every path under the sun
Jump the bridges I burn
I have climbed and swum and crawled
But it's still on my back
This ever growing dark
Always returns
Through the sand and the mud
I spend my life on the run

Run
This siren my old friend
Keeps calling out my name
What if I met my end
Right now?

Mayday
Not okay
Caught in the same damn old
Groundhog day
Fiending
From within
The beast is out for blood
Closing in

And I know what it wants
And I'm not gonna bite
But I'm starting to feel out of breath
Like I'm stuck in a swamp
Day and night, it's a fight to the death

I spend my life on the run
Through the sand and the mud
Every path under the sun
Jump the bridges I burn
I have climbed and swum and crawled
But it's still on my back
This ever growing dark
Always returns
Through the sand and the mud
I spend my life on the run

I spend my life
I spend my life on the run
I spend my life
I spend my life on the run
