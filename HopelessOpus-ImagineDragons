Hey, Mr. Cage-man, let me get a fresh breath
Cherry bomb, headstrong, I could fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate-man, shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go long, throwing me a sharp right

It's not a picture-perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place that I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr. Safe-man, hustle me an okay
I could slide, take a dive, take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Postman, slip me one more green note
I've been low, hit the floor, looking just to make broke

It's not a picture-perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place that I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

Hey, Mr. C-
Hey, hey, Mr., hey, Mr. Cage-man
Cherry bomb (margana na si ereht)
Let me, ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-cherry bomb

I've got this place that I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus
