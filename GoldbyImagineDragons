Who We Are
Song by

Imagine Dragons

Up in the morning, up in the evening
Picking out clocks, so the birds come back to eat
Oh, to eat

Up on the mountain, down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks in the heat of the afternoon
Oh, afternoon

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

Oh, it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day

(Oh, won't you) save us from what we are?
Don't look clear, and it's all uphill from here
Oh-oh

Up in the attic, down in the cellar
Lost in the static, coming back for more
Oh, for more

Out with the reason, in with the season
Taking down names in my book of jealousy
Jealousy

We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No

Oh, it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day

Because it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day

(Oh, won't you) save us from what we are?
Don't look clear, and it's all uphill from here
Oh

They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy

They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy
They say we're crazy

Oh, it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day

Because it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day

(Oh, won't you) save us from what we are?
Don't look clear, and it's all uphill from here (it always is)
(And they say we're crazy) oh
