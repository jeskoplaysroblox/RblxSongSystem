Mystical Magical
Song by

Benson Boone

There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along
Like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warning
And you kiss me like you want it
How rude, how rude

But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, enjoy my company
My company

Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream
Taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies

'Cause it feels so mystical, magical, oh, baby
'Cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical, oh, baby
'Cause once you know, once you know

My little hard-to-get baby
I want to give you the world (ooh)
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit of
Something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out

But I like it anyways
'Cause I think I'm getting closer to you every day
I know you'll come around to me eventually
Just sit back, relax, enjoy my company
Oh, baby, trust me

Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right
You can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream
Taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies

'Cause it feels so mystical, magical, oh, baby
'Cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical, oh, baby
'Cause once you know, once you know (ooh)

Once you know what my love's gonna feel like (ooh, ooh)
Moonbeam ice cream, nothing else will feel right (ooh)

Mystical, magical, oh, baby
It's mystical, magical
